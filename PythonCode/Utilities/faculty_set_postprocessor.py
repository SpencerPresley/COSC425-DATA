class FacultyPostprocessor:
    """
    A class responsible for processing and standardizing faculty data across different categories.

    This class provides methods to extract faculty sets from category data, remove near-duplicate names,
    and standardize faculty names to ensure consistency across categories. It utilizes MinHash for estimating
    the similarity between names to effectively identify and remove duplicates. Additionally, it maintains
    a dictionary of name variations to track the most frequent spelling variations of each name.

    Attributes:
        temp_dict (dict): Temporary storage for faculty names and their occurrences.
        faculty_occurence_dict (dict): Tracks occurrences of faculty names across categories.
        processed_sets_list (list): Stores processed faculty sets after deduplication and standardization.
        minhash_util (MinHashUtility): Utility for generating MinHash signatures and comparing them.
        name_variations (dict): Stores NameVariation objects for each normalized faculty name.

    Methods:
        get_temp_dict(): Returns the temporary dictionary containing faculty names and their occurrences.
        extract_faculty_sets(category_dict): Extracts faculty sets from each CategoryInfo object in the provided dictionary.
        remove_near_duplicates(category_dict): Processes each CategoryInfo object to remove near-duplicate faculty names and standardize them.
        standardized_data_update(category_dict, standardized_sets): Updates CategoryInfo objects with standardized faculty sets.
        standardize_faculty(category_dict): Standardizes faculty names across all categories based on the most frequent spelling variations.
        remove_update_faculty(category_dict, faculty_sets_list): Removes near-duplicate faculty names within each faculty set.
        duplicate_postprocessor(faculty_set, faculty_sets, similarity_threshold): Processes a set of faculty names to remove near-duplicates.
        process_name_pair(similarity_threshold, most_frequent_variation, name_signatures, to_remove, n1, n2): Compares two names and determines which to keep.
        name_to_remove(most_frequent_variation, n1, n2, n1_normalized, n2_normalized): Determines which of two names to remove based on their variations.
        get_duplicate_utilities(faculty_set, faculty_sets): Generates utilities needed for duplicate removal.

class MinHashUtility:
    """
    A utility class for performing MinHash calculations to estimate the similarity between sets of data.

    This class provides methods for generating hash functions, tokenizing strings into n-grams, computing MinHash signatures,
    and comparing these signatures to estimate the similarity between sets. The MinHash technique is particularly useful
    in applications where exact matches are not necessary, but approximate matches are sufficient, such as duplicate
    detection, document similarity, and clustering.

    Attributes:
        num_hashes (int): The number of hash functions to use in MinHash calculations, affecting the accuracy and
                          performance of the similarity estimation.
        large_prime (int): A large prime number used as the modulus in hash functions to minimize collisions.
        hash_fns (list[callable]): A list of pre-generated hash functions used for computing MinHash signatures.

    Methods:
        tokenize(string, n): Tokenizes a string into n-grams.
        generate_coefficients(): Generates random coefficients for hash functions.
        generate_hash_functions(): Creates a list of hash functions based on generated coefficients.
        compute_signature(tokens): Computes the MinHash signature for a set of tokens.
        compare_signatures(signature1, signature2): Compares two MinHash signatures and returns their estimated similarity.

    The class utilizes linear hash functions of the form h(x) = (a * x + b) % large_prime, where 'a' and 'b' are randomly
    generated coefficients. This approach helps in reducing the likelihood of hash collisions and ensures a uniform
    distribution of hash values.

    Example usage:
        minhash_util = MinHashUtility(num_hashes=200)
        tokens = minhash_util.tokenize("example string", n=3)

        Generate a list of linear hash functions for use in MinHash calculations.

        Each hash function is defined by a unique pair of coefficients (a, b) and is created using a factory function.
        These hash functions are used to compute hash values for elements in a set, which are essential for estimating
        the similarity between sets using the MinHash technique.

        The hash functions are of the form: h(x) = (a * x + b) % large_prime, where 'large_prime' is a large prime number
        used to reduce collisions in hash values.
