The aim is to prevent health problems from happening or re-occurring by implementing educational programs, developing policies, administering services, and conducting research. In many cases, treating a disease or controlling a pathogen can be vital to preventing it in others, such as during an outbreak. Vaccination programs and distribution of condoms to prevent the spread of communicable diseases are examples of common preventive public health measures, as are educational campaigns to promote vaccination and the use of condoms (including overcoming resistance to such).\" - wikipedia"

        "definition": "\"Biological psychology, also known as biopsychology, is a field in psychology that analyzes how thoughts, behaviors, and emotions are influenced by biological factors. This branch of psychology examines how the brain, nervous system, hormones, and genetics impact an individual's mental processes and behavior. Biological psychologists study a wide range of topics, including brain structure and function, neurotransmitters, genetics, and the effects of various biological processes on psychological phenomena.\" - wikipedia"
